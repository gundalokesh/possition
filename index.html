            <span>There is no way around it. The game itsself (not including the hacker problem) is near perfect. It's absolutely balanced, it's smooth, the mechanics are not like in other shooters, the competitiveness of the game is on another level.

                Personally I do not come across hackers alot, but I do think that there are quite afew cheaters around in the lower ranks, but I feel like Valves anti-cheat is finally catching up.
                
                IDK how you can rate this anything below a 10, unless you have only played it for a couple hours and come across aton of cheaters.
                When year 2000 there was no game like Counter-Strike... With it Graphics, SFX, game style and everything it was a revolution in multiplayer games, not in just FPS games. Imagine a game that actually is a mod of another big game but more popular... (I'm not saying better.) Counter-Strike: Source is also has amazing graphics and SFX. Most of the players don't like CSS weapon system, because it wasn't easy actually. I think Counter-Strike was better but also Source was quite good. Even if the game style doesn't suit you, you need to admit in 2004 this game was revolution too. After many years later this little improved Global Offensive came. Basically there was nothing to tell. Not even avarage graphics, SFXs are old, not even changed. This is basically just the CSS with CS weapon style with rank and online matching system. Before this game came out there was Battlefield 3 look at that, it has amazing graphics, so much better than this crap game. When the real Counter-Strike came there wasn't a Call Of Duty game. Actually 3 years later the first Call Of Duty game released. Some new-born players will say "Graphics not important in online game, you need FPS." so what about gameplay? Gameplay is also the same, not improved it just get easier. Good graphic with good optimization is possible like in CSS. We need a real Counter-Strike. Without Nexon, Hidden Path or something else. Just VALVE need to do it.
